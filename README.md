## Intro
This was originally a technical exercise I was given for a Senior Backend Engineer role utilizing TypeScript and Next.js. 
They gave very positive feedback, particularly about the code's simplicity.
The goal was to do some basic analysis of words within documents, somewhat similar to the types of analysis they regularly performed. 
See the Pull Requests tab for more details about the types of analysis that were implemented and the code that goes along with them.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo: `git clone {REPO_URL}`

1. CD into the repo: `cd /path/to/repo`

1. Start via docker compose: `docker-compose up` ([walkthrough video](https://www.loom.com/share/afd822145a384b449cd8275cd374fb7f?sid=7069ccb0-3880-45b6-afa1-72ad28a284eb)).

1. Once running, visit `http://localhost:3000/` to load the app--the first load might be slow. You should see the following page if everything is successful.

1. Click on the side icon below Home, which should bring up the page to test the endpoints.
